            <p class="ptitle"> 🔵 A little bit about me 🔵</p>
            <p>
            Hello there! My name is Joy Macharia from Nyeri, Kenya in Africa. I am a final year 
            high school student, and I've been homeschooled for about 8 years! I enjoy doing art, 
            gardening, and teaching children in my church and neighborhood.
            </p>
            <p class="ptitle"> 🔵 Code Chica 🔵</p>
            <p>I was introduced to the Code Chica certification program by a great friend and mentor 
            of mine in August 2022, and it seemed like exactly what I was looking for;  a structured 
            and affordable program that could train me on the basics of web development. I am grateful 
            to Latinitas and the entire team at Code Chica for the time and effort in developing and running 
            programs that are making such a great impact. As I have gone through this program I have gained
            more confidence and I am now pursuing my dreams of being a Software Engineer with more zeal!
            </p>
            <p>
            In future, I would like to pursue a career in technology and teach young children about the same.
            I  also hope to help small businesses improve their efficiency by developing reliable software and 
            educating them on different uses of technology in business. 
            </p>

            <p class="ptitle"> 🔵 My Inspiration 🔵</p>
            <p>On September 10, 2022 I launched a program called the Hope. It is a 4-month project in Nyeri that runs every Saturday for 2-3 hours. The goal of this project is to :  
            <br>Equip children with basic computer skills while incorporating activities in mathematics and science.
            <br>Expose the children to various careers within and outside STEM.
            <br>Encourage the students to explore the world of technology and STEM fields.
            <br>Strive to instill in each child the belief that they can pursue their dreams and succeed regardless of their background.
            <br>Promote the development of soft skills such as leadership, teamwork, and problem-solving.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am currently working with Upendo Children's Home in my community in Nyeri which hosts about 25 children. Some topics we will cover by the end of the program include Word Processing with Microsoft Word, 
            Presentations with PowerPoint, Leadership, Career Exploration, Introduction to Computer Programming, and more! 
            <br>
            <br>
            Over the last 8 Weeks these children have inspired me through their digiligence and curiosity to continue developing my skills so I can achieve my dreams.
            <br>
            <br>
            This project has been fruitful, and the children have progressed from not knowing how to use a computer to being able to have fun and learn with one. 
            A challenge we have had is the lack of enough computers for the children to learn.
            <br>
